# Educational AI & Equity: Supporting Fair Learning Analytics

This repository supports my ongoing research titled **"Embodied Reasoning and Algorithmic Mediation in Dynamic Mathematics Environments"**, prepared for submission to the 2025 PME-NA Conference.

## 📚 Overview

This project investigates how AI-driven educational tools—such as adaptive learning platforms and intelligent tutoring systems—affect students' reasoning, equity of access, and affective engagement, especially in mathematics learning contexts.

## 🔍 Research Focus

- How do algorithms mediate learning in dynamic environments like Desmos and GeoGebra?
- What design principles promote transparency and fairness in student modeling?
- How can embodied reasoning frameworks inform ethical AI in education?

## 📊 Key Features

- Sample simulations of AI-tutored learning paths
- Visualizations of student interaction logs and concept maps
- Open code for fairness-aware intervention detection

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Dynamic mathematics environments APIs (Desmos API simulations)

## 📎 Future Work

This repository will be updated with draft papers, data excerpts, and visual demos as the research progresses.
